# Motivation behind the project
As we know, the newcomers always feel at a lost after coming into CSE department regarding programming. They usually do not know how to start coding and what to do concerning that. So they need help from the someone who has walked through the same path. But some students hesitate to ask for help or don't know whom to ask or where to go. Moreover, the students from other departments go through the same issue as they have non-major courses of CSE. This SUST Programming Community will help them. Our target is not just for the newcomers only but for every students. Every students need help at some point. And each one of us is expertise at different stuffs. We never know from whom we can get a little advice that can make a big difference in our knowledge.
